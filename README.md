# Management
🏨 Project Overview: Hotel Management ProgrammeThe project is a command-line application designed to simulate the basic workflow of a hotel's check-in and billing process. Its primary function is to collect guest information, check their nationality for documentation requirements, allow them to select a room, and calculate the total bill, including a 20% Goods and Services Tax (GST).
🌟 Key FeaturesGuest Check-in Loop: Allows for continuous data entry for multiple guests until the user explicitly chooses to stop.Basic Data Collection: Gathers essential guest details like name, phone number, address, nationality, check-in, and check-out dates.Nationality-Based Document Check:If the guest is "Indian", it prompts for an "Aadhar Card no."Otherwise, it prints "Passport Needed."Room Selection: Presents four fixed room types with their corresponding prices per night:Standard Non-AC (₹1,500)Standard AC (₹2,000)Deluxe AC (₹2,800)VIP Suite (₹3,800)Automated Billing: Calculates the total cost based on the room price and the number of days of stay.GST Calculation: Automatically adds a 20% GST to the base amount to determine the final bill.
🛠️ Technologies/Tools UsedCategoryComponentDescriptionProgramming LanguagePythonThe entire programme is written in Python.Tools/LibrariesStandard LibraryNo external libraries are used. The code relies solely on built-in Python functions like input(), print(), int(), and dictionary/string manipulation.Execution EnvironmentCommand-Line Interface (CLI)The programme is run and interacts with the user via a standard terminal or console.
⚙️ Steps to Install and Run the ProjectSince this is a simple script using only standard Python, the installation and running process is straightforward.            1. InstallationInstall Python: Ensure you have a recent version of Python 3 installed on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).Save the Code: Copy the entire code block (from both screenshots) and save it as a file named hotel_management.py (or any .py extension).
2. Running the ProjectOpen Terminal/Command Prompt: Navigate to the directory where you saved the hotel_management.py file.Execute the Script: Run the following command:Bashpython hotel_management.py
Follow the Prompts: The programme will start executing, prompting you to enter guest details, room selection, and days of stay.
✅ Instructions for TestingYou can test the program by running through different scenarios to verify that the logic and calculations are correct.Test CaseSteps to PerformExpected Output/VerificationSingle Guest Check-in
1. Enter all guest details. 2. Enter "no" for the next_entry prompt.The program should exit the loop and continue to the nationality check.Multiple Guest Check-in1. Enter details for Guest 1, enter "yes" for next_entry.2. Enter details for Guest 2, enter "no" for next_entry.The final Record output will only contain the details for Guest 2 due to the way the dictionary is being overwritten in the loop. (This highlights a bug to be aware of).Nationality Check (Indian)Enter nationality as "Indian".The program should prompt you for "Aadhar Card no."Nationality Check (Foreigner)Enter nationality as "USA" (or any value other than "Indian").The program should print "Passport Needed".Billing (Standard AC)Room: Standard AC (sel=2). Days (n):3. Principle Price: ₹2,000. Amount (excluding GST): $2000 \times 3 = \text{₹}6,000$. GST: $6000 \times 0.2 = \text{₹}1,200$. Total Amount: $\text{₹}6,000 + \text{₹}1,200 = \text{₹}7,200$.Billing (VIP Suite)Room: VIP Suite (sel=4). Days (n):4. 5.Principle Price: ₹3,800. Amount (excluding GST): $3800 \times 5 = \text{₹}19,000$. GST: $19000 \times 0.2 = \text{₹}3,800$. Total Amount: $\text{₹}19,000 + \text{₹}3,800 = \text{₹}22,800$.
